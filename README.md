Part 2. Scripted CI/CD Pipeline
1. Set up a New Jenkins Pipeline:
Create a new Jenkins pipeline, but this time choose the "Pipeline script" option. This approach is more imperative than declarative.
2. Write an Scipted Pipeline Script:
In the pipeline script, define the stages, steps, and build process for your application using Groovy DSL. Be sure to include stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.
3. Connect Jenkins to Your Git Repository:
Configure the new Jenkins pipeline to connect to your Git repository and set up a webhook just like in the declarative approach.
4. Run the Scripted Pipeline:
Push a change to your code repository and observe how Jenkins triggers the imperative pipeline you created using the script
